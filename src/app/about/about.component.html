        <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
          Hey there! I’m a software developer who loves turning messy ideas into
          clean, scalable code that actually works. Angular and Java are my
          favorite tools, and I get a real buzz out of building smooth,
          user-friendly interfaces that make people’s lives easier (and maybe
          even a little more fun).
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
          I’ve been coding since 2018, but I’ve always been a problem-solver at
          heart. My background in mechanical engineering taught me how to think
          systematically, break things down, find the logic, and build them back
          up smarter than before. That mindset naturally carried over into
          software development.
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
          I started my professional journey at Union Systems Limited, Africa’s
          leading financial software company. Union Systems delivers
          forward-thinking digital solutions that help banks and corporates
          across the continent achieve full automation and digitisation of their
          trade operations.
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
          As a frontend developer, I worked on a B2B trade finance platform,
          building complex UI components such as import documents, letters of
          credit, and warrants forms using Angular, HTML, CSS, and TypeScript.
          When the backend team hit a gap, I decided to dive into Java with
          spring boot and MySQL to help out. Before long, I was developing
          backend logic and API endpoints, bridging the gap between frontend and
          backend to keep the whole system moving. That experience turned me
          into a full-stack developer and gave me a deeper understanding of how
          the entire product comes together.
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-300">
          While at Union Systems, I also took on a contract role with Woodcore
          Inc., a company that empowers commercial banks, microfinance banks,
          neobanks, fintechs, and credit unions with robust banking technology.
          Woodcore’s comprehensive solutions help financial institutions deliver
          superior products and services that truly delight their customers.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="mt-4">
        <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
          At Woodcore, I worked as a frontend developer on several projects,
          including two core banking applications: one for banks and another for
          customers. I also developed a mobile onboarding app and an internal
          admin platform that helped teams work more efficiently. My job was to
          turn Figma designs into responsive, engaging interfaces using Angular,
          Bootstrap, and a few handy npm packages. Some projects were team
          efforts that strengthened my collaboration skills, while others I
          handled independently, which really sharpened my problem-solving
          abilities and sense of ownership.
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
          After a few years in the field, I realised I wanted to grow beyond the
          code to understand the bigger picture of technology, people, and
          design. I saw that I could be even more valuable if I deepened my
          knowledge and broadened my perspective. That realisation led me on a
          personal quest for growth, where I pursued a Master’s in Information
          Technology at Bournemouth University (UK).
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
          There, I explored human-centred design, cloud computing, data
          management, and persuasive technology; subjects that connect code to
          real human impact. Along the way, I freelanced, experimented, and
          stayed hands-on with the latest tools and trends, making sure the
          learning never stopped.
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-300 mb-4">
          Now, I’m ready to jump back into a team where I can build things that
          matter, keep learning on the fly, and have some fun doing it. When I’m
          not buried in code, you’ll probably find me watching football
          highlights, binging a great movie, or going down a rabbit hole with
          some new dev tool I just discovered. Always learning, always curious,
          always building.
